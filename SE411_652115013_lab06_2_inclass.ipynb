    "We consider the simple forward-chaining algorithm presented in <em>Figure 9.3</em>. We look at each rule in the knowledge base and see if the premises can be satisfied. This is done by finding a substitution which unifies each of the premise with a clause in the `KB`. If we are able to unify the premises, the conclusion (with the corresponding substitution) is added to the `KB`. This inferencing process is repeated until either the query can be answered or till no new sentences can be added. We test if the newly added clause unifies with the query in which case the substitution yielded by `unify` is an answer to the query. If we run out of sentences to infer, this means the query was a failure.\n",
